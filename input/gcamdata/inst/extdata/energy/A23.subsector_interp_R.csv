# Title: Region-specific electric subsector shareweights interpolation rules by GCAM4 region
# WARNING: These are hard coding GCAM 4 region names (i.e. 32 regions).  If the region definitions change this file may not match.
# Units: Unitless share-weights
# Source: GCAM assumptions; documented in proposal 210_GCAM4p1_Electricity Generation Assumptions.pdf (page 23)
